My application for the project component of EES4100

This application was built upon the ESS4100 Testbench application provided by Kim Taylor 
located in the github repository kmtaylor/EES4100_Testbench. 

The application uses code developed in grimthebunny/hello_world, the full history of the development of the 
application can be seen between the two repositories, prior to 23/10/2015 the program was called bacnet_server.c

The primary application is:

bacmod_bridge:
    The application (bacmod_bridge) is designed to form a bridge between a system sending Modbus data(140.159.153.159) 
    to a system requiring BACNET messages(140.159.160.7). The system reads in new data from the Modbus server every second in 
    a dedicated thread,the system responds to read property requests from the BACNET Client which occur 
    approximatly once ever 100ms
    
    Data received from the Modbus server is stored in a linked list and is read out of this link list when 
    a vaild read property request is received from the application and then sent to the client making the 
    request.
    
    For this project i was assigned the following device details which are hard coded into the application:
    Modbus registers: 80-82
    BACnet device no: 80, Analogue Instances: 0-2
