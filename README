My application for the project component of EES4100

This application was built upon the ESS4100 Testbench application provided by Kim Taylor 
located in the github repository kmtaylor/EES4100_Testbench. 

The application uses code developed in grimthebunny/hello_world, the full history of the development of the 
application can be seen between the two repositories

The primary application is:

bacnet_server:
    The application (bacnet_server) is designed to form a bridge between a system sending Modbus data to a
    system requiring BACNET messages. The system reads in new data from the Modbus server every second in 
    a dedicated thread,the system responds to read property requests from the BACNET Client which occur 
    approximatly once ever 100ms
    
    Data received from the Modbus server is stored in a linked list and is read out of this link list when 
    a vaild read property request is received from the application and then sent to the client making the 
    request.
    
    
Local test clients for the Modbus server and BACNET client are also included in this repository: 

bacnet_client:
    This application will continually poll for devices with subdirectories in
    RANDOM_DATA_POOL. Once a device has been found, it will send a
    Read_Property request to as many Analog_Input object instances as required
    by the data in the device's RANDOM_DATA_POOL.

    bacnet_client acts as a BBMD and expects register_with_bbmd requests.

modbus_server:
    The Modbus server that expects connections from bacnet_server. It will
    provide data as provided by RANDOM_DATA_POOL. The BACnet device number to
    register number mapping is as follows:
	
	BACnet Side			Modbus Side

	Device 12 AI Instance 0		Register 12
	Device 12 AI Instance 1		Register 13
	Device 12 AI Instance 2		Register 14
	Device 120 AI Instance 0	Register 120 ...
